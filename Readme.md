# Welcome to TBDNN !

TBDNN is an open-source project for material science. It intends to generate 
Slaster-Koster tight-binding parameters using deep learning approaches such 
as multilayer perceptron, conventional neural networks, recurrent neural
networks from the output of density functional theory (DFT)calculatons.   
       
This is an ongoing project and I will update new results frequently. Stay tuned.     

**This project was supported via the nVidia Academic Program**

For details of the project -> [TBDNN Proposal](https://github.com/pipidog/TBDNN/blob/master/TBDNN%20proposal.pdf)
